# Automating `chiaki4deck` Launch

Now that you have `chiaki4deck` configured, it's time to make it wake up your PlayStation and connect to it automatically. 

!!! Info "So Why Should I Care?"

    This is especially convenient for the Steam Deck's `Game Mode` where an automated launch eliminates both the need to tap furiously at your touchscreen to launch the application and the glitches that would arise (flashes on your screen) when it would switch between the 2 open Chiaki windows (since only 1 window is opened with the automated launch). It also gives a default game mode option to launch in fullscreen, stretch or zoomed mode, making it [easier to use the 3 games modes](../updates/done.md#3-view-modes-for-non-standard-screen-sizes){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Finally, it allows for passing your login passcode automatically instead of manually typing in each time (for those of you with a login passcode set on your PlayStation console).


!!! Caution "Sleep Mode Required"

    For this to work, your PlayStation needs to either be in rest/sleep mode or on (so that it is listening for the wake up signal). This means you will want to keep your PlayStation in rest/sleep mode when you are not playing (instead of off).

    !!! Bug "Steam Deck Speaker Fails to Load, Crashing Official Chiaki and `chiaki4deck` in Desktop Mode"

        In Desktop Mode, the Steam Deck speaker (Raven) can fail to load on startup. This is rare but seems to happen every once in a while. Unfortunately, this reliably crashes Chiaki and by inheritance `chiaki4deck`, causing it to hang indefinitely. The only ways to exit Chiaki are to close the `konsole` window that launched it (if launched via automation), forcibly kill the process (`kill -9`) or forcibly shutoff the Steam Deck. I am working on a way to prevent this from crashing Chiaki in a bugfix (and hopefully :fingers_crossed: someone is working on the underlying Steam Deck speaker driver issue causing this). In the meantime, **there are 2 good workarounds that prevent this from occurring** (either one works). Please use one of the following when using Chiaki or `chiaki4deck`:
        
        - After booting into Desktop Mode, adjust the volume of the Steam Deck (hit the + or -) volume button (only needs to be done once per boot). You will see this cause Raven to load if it hasn't already. Now, you are safe to launch either Chiaki or `chiaki4deck` at any time until you turn off your Steam Deck.

            **OR**

        - Use `chiaki4deck` and/or `Chiaki` in Game Mode when possible; the speaker not loading hardware error doesn't occur there.

1. Open a `konsole` session (launch it via `Applications` by clicking the Steam icon in the bottom left and searching for it in the `All Applications` section)

2. Get your PlayStation IP

    1. Get your registered PlayStation's IP Address

        1. Launch Chiaki via your desktop or via:
            
            ``` bash
            flatpak run re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck
            ```

        2. Get your IP address via the console widget and then close the window and return to the `konsole` session

            ![IP Address](images/GetAddress.png)

3. Create script for waking PlayStation and launching Chiaki

    === "Automated Instructions (Recommended)"

        1. Run the [gen-launcher script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/main/scripts/gen-launcher.sh){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} using the following command in your `konsole` and answer the prompts (you will need your IP address from step 2 above)

            ``` bash
            bash <(curl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/main/scripts/gen-launcher.sh)
            ```

    === "Manual Instructions (For People who like to do things by hand)"

        1. Get your console nickname

            1. It was the nickname listed with your console in the console widget. It can also be obtained with

                ```bash
                flatpak run re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck list
                ```

                ???+ example "Example Output"

                    ``` bash
                    Host: PS5-012
                    ```

                    In this example, the console nickname is `PS5-012`, please use your nickname. If you have multiple, choose the one from the list you want and choose the corresponding regist_key in the next step (i.e.,  if you pick the console on the 2nd line here, pick the regist_key on the 2nd line in the next step).

        2. Get your remote play registration key

            1. Run the following command in your console

                ``` bash
                cat ~/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki.conf | grep regist_key | cut -d '(' -f2 | cut -d '\' -f1
                ```

                ???+ example "Example Output"

                    ``` bash
                    2ebf539d
                    ```

                !!! Note "Chiaki Configuration File"

                    This command is printing the Chiaki configuration file generated when you ran `chiaki4deck` for the first time. This is where the flatpak version of Chiaki saves your settings and details. In fact, all flatpaks store their details with the ~/.var/app/app_id pattern. If you want to look at the file itself and get the value you can open the file at `/home/deck/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki.conf` and look for the remote play registration key [`rp_regist_key`].


        3. Choose your [default launch option](../updates/done.md#3-view-modes-for-non-standard-screen-sizes){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (fullscreen, zoom, or stretch)

            - fullscreen: A full screen picture with black bars, aspect ratio maintained

            - zoom: A full screen zoomed picture with no black bars, aspect ratio maintained, edges of image cut off by zoom

            - stretch: A full screen stretched picture with no black bars, aspect ratio slightly distorted by vertical [in the case of Steam Deck] stretch

            !!! Info "Default Launch Option"

                This is the option remote play will launch with. You can always toggle to a different option by using the ++ctrl+s++ (toggles between stretch and normal) and ++ctrl+z++ (toggles between zoom and normal) options which should be set if desired in the Steam controller configuration for the game. See [Controller Configuration Section](controlling.md){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for more details.

        4. Get your 4 digit PlayStation login passcode (if applicable). You will know your PlayStation login passcode if you have one because you have to enter it every time you log onto your PlayStation console. If you don't have to do this, you don't have a PlayStation login passcode and will leave that field blank.

        5. Create a new blank file located in the folder `/home/deck/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki` named  `Chiaki-launcher.sh`

            ```bash
            touch "${HOME}/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki-launcher.sh"
            ```
        
        6. Open the `/home/deck/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki-launcher.sh` file in your favorite editor and save the following output.

            ``` bash
            #!/usr/bin/env bash

                echo "Error: Please make sure you are using the correct PlayStation # (4 or 5)." >&2
                echo "Error: If not, change the wakeup call to use the number of your PlayStation console" >&2
                exit 2
            }

            timeout_error()
            {
                echo "Error: PlayStation console didn't become ready in 35 seconds!" >&2
                echo "Error: Please change 35 to a higher number in your script if this persists." >&2
                exit 1

        7. Edit the `/home/deck/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki-launcher.sh` file, replacing the following values for your values:

            1. `<console_ip>`

            2. `<console_nickname>`

                !!! Caution "Beware of '"

                    If you have any ' in your nickname itself, such as `Street Pea's PS5`, you will need enter the `'` as `'\''`. Thus, for `Street Pea's PS5` instead of using `Street Pea's PS5` you would use `Street Pea'\''s PS5`. All other characters are fine. This is due to the PlayStation console allowing any manner of names (including non-valid hostnames with all manner of special characters) and Chiaki using that name in its configuration file.


            3. `<remote_play_registration_key>`

            4. `<launch_option>`

            5. `<playstation_console>` (either 4 or 5)

            6. `<login_passcode>` (just erase this field if you don't have a login passcode)

                !!! Note "Example is Without Login Passcode #"

                    If you have a passcode you would set it like `--passcode 1111`, changing the last line of the example above to `flatpak run re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck --passcode 1111 --zoom stream 'PS5-012' 192.168.1.16`

        7. Make the script executable:

            ```bash
            chmod +x "${HOME}/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki-launcher.sh"
            ```

4. Test your newly created script (if you haven't already) by running:
        
    ```bash
    "${HOME}/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki-launcher.sh"
    ```

    === "Your script worked!"
    
        !!! success "We have liftoff! :rocket:"

            Chiaki launched in your desired screen mode on your Steam Deck! Congratulations!

    === "Your script didn't work..."

        !!! Error "You are no longer on the happy path :weary:"

            === "Script fails before launching stream window"

                Check the error message and fix issues if obvious. Otherwise, things to check:
                
                1. Make sure your PlayStation console is in either rest/sleep mode or on (otherwise this won't work)
                
                2. Double check the values you entered in the script to make sure they are correct.
                
                3. Open your script at: `/home/deck/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki-launcher.sh` and try to run each command individually to see what's causing your problem.
                
                4. Check your current router settings, ensure UPnP is enabled, alongisde ports UDP 987, TCP/UDP 9295, UDP 9296-9297
                
                5. If issues persist with this and `chiaki4deck` launches fine regularly via the application link, just not the automation, feel free to reach out.

            === "Error in stream window"
 
                Close `chiaki4deck` gracefully by closing any open dialog boxes and then using ++ctrl+q++ on the stream window. If `chiaki4deck` doesn't close gracefully, move your mouse to the top left corner of the stream window and a blue circle should highlight the corner of the screen. Click on it to see all of your windows and select the `konsole` window. Then, close the `konsole` window itself (click its `x` icon in the top right corner). Next, you can relaunch the script again to make sure it wasn't a one-time snafu. Note: Chiaki seems to perform better (audio/visual quality) in `Game Mode` vs. `Desktop Mode` for me.
